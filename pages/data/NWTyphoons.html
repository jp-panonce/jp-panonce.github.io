                            <h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Typhoons, Cyclones, Hurricanes.. <br>
                                However you call it, they will always be a  threat to livelihood and human lives. The NW Pacific Basin produces on average 26 storms per year making it the most active region for typhoons. <br>
                                In this dashboard I created, Let's explore all the storms that have ever hit this area. We will try to identify patterns in terms of storm frequency, pressure and the destruction they have caused. </p>
                            

                            <h2>How to use the dashboard</h2>

                            <p>The dashboard is divided into <b>3</b> views: By Year, Patterns, and Impacts</p>
                            
                            <h3>By Year</h3>
                            <p>The <b>By Year</b> view displays a map showing typhoon tracking data and strength for a specified Pacific Typhoon Season. The typhoon season is selected on a dropdown on the upper-left side of the map, below which contains the names of all storms that hit that year. Each name, when clicked, will display the track of ONLY the selected storm.</p>
                            
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/typhoon_dashboard_byView.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <p>The map shows the track of all the storms on the selected typhoon season, OR a selected storm name. Each dot on the track represents the location of the storm per day and is colored according to the storm's strength. Each storm path is also labeled with the storm's name. When cursor is hovered on one of the dots, the speed of storm (in knots) at said location is also displayed. </p>

                            <p>At the bottom of the map, </p>

							<h2>Implementation</h2>

                            <h3>Data Sources</h3>

                            <h4>Storm Meteorological Data</h4>
							<p>The data used in this dashboard is obtained from the <b><i><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive">International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)</a></i></b> project. Their website contains the most complete global collection of tropical storms available. Also, it's completely available to the public. </p>

                            <p>For this dashboard, I used the IBTrACS Version 4 which was their latest version.</p>


                            <h4>Storm Impact</h4>
                            <p>Although, the IBTrACS data is large dataset, it still does not have data for the # of deaths and damages each storm caused. After a little bit of research, I found many sources to have different numbers and most of these numbers are not in an organized form and rather, they are nested within articles which makes it very inefficient to look into each storm on record and read all the articles related to each. I expected each countries government agencies to have the data but I can't seem to find organized data form their websites. </p>
                            <p>An efficient, though unreliable solution would be to use Wikipedia. Suprisingly, they have an article for each typhoon season which include countries affected, # of deaths and resulting damages in USD. I decided then to utilize it for the lack of better data source. Here is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Pacific_typhoon_season#Season_effects">NW Pacific Typhoon Season article </a>.</p>

							<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
                            <h4>IBTrACS Dataset</h4>
							<p>The IBTrACS data can be downloaded on a csv format which I preferred since it's easier to manage. The fields used in the dataset are described in their <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/IBTrACS_v04_column_documentation.pdf">Column Documentation</a>. </p>
